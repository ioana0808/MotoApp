* **Purpose**<br/>
MotorRide was build to represent my *Graduation Thesis*.<br/>

* **Functionality**<br/>
MotorRide is an Android Application destined for motorcycle riders. 
It can record your routes, by clicking on the *Strart * button. It can
also display the *Instant Speed*, during your ride and at the end of your route it will
give you a short overview on your just finished route.
You can create an account and register to it. It helps you keep trak over your routes.
This feature needs more work, it's not fully functional and it's not connected to the rest of the app.
